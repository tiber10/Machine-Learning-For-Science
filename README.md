In this repository, i uploaded the solutions of the prospective  evaluation set by ML4S for GSoC 2021 Students.

## GSoC Deep Lense
### Common Test I. Simulating Superfluid Dark Matter (DM) with PyAutoLens 
Task: Modify and/or use the already existing functionality of PyAutoLens to simulate strong lensing from superfluid dark matter. Specifically,
you will need to simulate the effects of lensing from a linear mass density - imagine this being a string of mass on galactic scales.

The submitted solution for this task has been uploaded on Simulating Superfluid Dark Matter (DM) with PyAutoLens.ipynb file.

### Specific Test III. Learning Mass of Dark Matter Halo
Task: Using the provided dataset implement a regression algorithm to learn the mapping between lensing images and the lensing dark matter halo mass.
You can use the machine learning algorithm of your choice. Please implement your approach in PyTorch and discuss your strategy.
